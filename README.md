# BMI-CALCULATOR

This is simply a BMI Calculator app designed and developed using flutter.

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet).

A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

With this ads-free BMI Calculator you can measure and evaluate your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the relevant information you provide on body weight, height, age and sex.
